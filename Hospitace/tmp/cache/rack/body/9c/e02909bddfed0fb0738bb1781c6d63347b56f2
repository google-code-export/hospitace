It should motivate to ask questions and to look forward to further courses. The motivation gained helps to endure challenging mathematics and basic technology classes on their way toward high quality engineering education. The participants form teams to design and build an autonomous mobile robot by using LEGO Mindstorms. By experiments, toys, and team work they encounter basic ideas and principles of several scientific and engineering fields and consequently will better chose their specialization later.  Students get a flavor of creative engineering and research work at the very beginning of their studies. The teams will compete against each other in a public final RoboRace contest."},"descriptionEn":{"line":"The course aims to create an interest in the ideas and possibilities of signals, systems and control.
