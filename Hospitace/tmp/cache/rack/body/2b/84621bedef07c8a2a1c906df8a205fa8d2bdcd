In contrast to standard binary search trees used in one dimension, the presented theory focuses on multidimensional data used to describe 3D scenes. In addition to the theory, the course emphasizes individual and team projects, where the importance and advantages of multidimensional data are demonstrated on practical examples."},"descriptionEn":{"line":"The main topic of the lectures are the data structures used in computer graphics. The basic and hierarchical data structures over point and object data will be addressed. The focus of the lectures and exercises is nearest and k-nearest neighbor search, ray shooting, z-buffer based visibility algorithms and collision detection. The students will have their own projects."},"keywordsCz":"sorting, searching, multidimensional data structures, objects representations, ray shooting, ray tracing, visibility computations, visibility culling, collision detection.","keywordsEn":"sorting, searching, multidimensional data structures, objects representations, ray shooting, ray tracing, visibility computations, visibility culling, collision detection.","lecturesContentsCz":{"line":["1.
